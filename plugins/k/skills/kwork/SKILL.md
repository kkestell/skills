## Compatibility

- Treat all paths in this skill as relative to the skill directory unless the host environment provides its own skill-directory variable.
- In Claude-style environments, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` may point at this directory. In Codex-style environments, resolve sibling paths like `assets/completeness-review-prompt.md` directly from this `SKILL.md`.
- If helper agents are unavailable, disallowed, or unnecessary, do the work and validation locally. Do not make delegation mandatory.
- Use project guidance docs when they exist, such as `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README`, package scripts, or repo-specific contributor docs.

## Workflow

### Pre-flight

1. Check that the git repo is clean.
   - Run `git status`. If there are staged changes, unstaged changes, or untracked files, stop and report them to the user.
   - Offer to commit the changes, add them to `.gitignore`, or stash them — whatever makes sense for what you see.
   - Do not proceed until the repo is clean or the user explicitly says to continue with dirty state.

### Orientation

2. Resolve `<input_document> $ARGUMENTS </input_document>`.
   - Prefer `docs/agents/plans/` for implementation plans and `docs/agents/todo/` for tracked follow-up work.
3. Read the work doc completely.
4. If anything is unclear or ambiguous after reading the plan, references, and related code, ask the user now.
   - Better to ask once before starting than to build the wrong thing. Get user approval to proceed.
   - Skip this step if the plan is clear and the path forward is obvious.
5. Verify the repo setup and baseline quality commands before major edits.
   - If helper agents are available and delegation is useful, you may delegate baseline verification.
   - Confirm dependencies are installed, then run tests, lint, formatter, and type checks as applicable.
   - Capture a concise baseline summary: what passed, what failed, and any broken baseline issues.
   - If the baseline is already broken, tell the user before proceeding.
6. Create a Todo list from the plan's implementation tasks.
   - Include testing tasks alongside implementation tasks.
   - Keep tasks specific and completable — each one should map to a checkable plan item.

### Execution

7. Execute the plan task by task — **code first, fix tests after**.
   - Read the related code and nearby patterns before implementing each task.
   - Implement in repo style. Match naming conventions, error handling patterns, and file organization.
   - Comment the code well. Comments should explain the architecture and the "why", not merely describe what the code does.
   - Write or update tests for each piece of new functionality, but don't stop to chase test failures mid-implementation. The goal is to get all the code written for a chunk first, then circle back to make the tests green.
   - Update Todo state and mark the matching plan checkbox complete (`[ ]` → `[x]`).
   - Keep the implementation aligned with the plan unless the user explicitly redirects or the plan is clearly wrong.
   - **After all code for a chunk is written**, run the relevant checks and fix any test failures or lint issues before moving to validation.
   - _Exception for longer, phased plans:_ If the plan has multiple phases that build on each other and the complexity is high enough that deferred test failures would be hard to diagnose, you may test as you go — but state why in your Todo list or message to the user before doing so. The default is still code-first.
8. If you find yourself spinning your wheels or faced with an unexpected obstacle, stop and ask the user for guidance.

Repeat steps 7–8 until the plan is complete.

If you start to run out of context, stop and offer a follow-up handoff or fresh-session continuation if the host environment supports it.

### Validate

After all plan work is complete, validate the full body of work with review passes.

9. Run the full suite.
    - Run tests, lint, formatter, and type checks as applicable.
    - Use the commands from the project's guidance docs or existing repo scripts, not ad hoc substitutes.
    - Fix any failures before proceeding.
10. Run two review passes over the completed work.
    - If helper agents are available and delegation is useful, run them in parallel. Otherwise perform these reviews locally.
    - For helper-agent reviews, include all necessary context in the prompt because each review may start with fresh context.
    - Build each review prompt by reading the corresponding template, then filling in the specifics of the full plan.
    - **Completeness review** — Read `assets/completeness-review-prompt.md` for the prompt framework. Fill in the plan path, all tasks completed, and the list of all changed files. The reviewer reads the plan and all changed files, then evaluates whether the work is genuinely complete with no omissions, hacks, disabled warnings, or workarounds. The reviewer should assume that the code builds and the tests pass and should not verify this itself.
    - **Test quality review** — Read `assets/test-quality-review-prompt.md` for the prompt framework. Fill in the plan path, all tasks completed, the test files, and the implementation files. The reviewer reads the implementation and tests, then evaluates whether the tests verify real behavior, cover edge cases, and would actually catch bugs.
11. Act on review findings.
    - If either reviewer reports issues worth fixing: fix them, then re-run the relevant quality checks.
    - If both reviewers pass, proceed to handoff.

### Commit & Handoff

12. Commit all work using the 7 rules of great commit messages and with no AI-tool attribution unless the project explicitly requires it.
    - All plan work, test fixes, and review fixes go into a single commit.
    - Do not commit if tests are failing or work is incomplete.
13. Report what shipped, quality-check results, commit summary, branch name, and any follow-up work.

## Principles

- **Start clean** — verify the repo state before touching anything.
- **The plan is your guide** — follow its references, don't reinvent.
- **Code first, then fix tests** — get the implementation down, then make it green. Except in complex phased work where early feedback is worth the interruption.
- **Commit once at the end** — all validated work in a single commit after review.
- **Validate at the end** — independent review passes catch what you miss across the full body of work.
- **Ship complete features** — don't leave things 80% done.

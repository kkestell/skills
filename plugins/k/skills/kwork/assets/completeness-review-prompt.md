# Completeness Review — Prompt Template

This is a prompt framework for a completeness review.
When launching a helper reviewer or running the pass locally, read this file, then compose the actual prompt
by filling in the concrete details for the current chunk of work.

---

## Preamble (copy and adapt)

You are reviewing a chunk of implementation work for completeness and
integrity. Your job is to determine whether the work was actually done —
not rubber-stamp it. Be honest. A false "pass" is worse than a nit.

## Context (fill in)

- **Plan path**: (repo-relative path to the plan file)
- **Project guidance docs**: (paths to repo-specific guidance such as `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README`, or other contributor docs)
- **Tasks completed in this chunk**: (bullet list of what was supposed to be done)
- **Files changed**: (repo-relative paths of all files added or modified)

## Instructions (copy verbatim)

1. Read the plan file and any relevant project guidance docs.
2. Read every changed file end to end. Do not skim.
3. Evaluate the work against the criteria below.

## What to look for

### Omissions
- Are all planned tasks for this chunk actually implemented?
- Is there anything the plan calls for that is missing, stubbed, or deferred without explanation?
- Are there TODO, FIXME, or HACK comments that indicate incomplete work?

### Shortcuts and hacks
- Were any compiler warnings, lint rules, or checks disabled to make things pass?
- Were any tests skipped, ignored, or marked as expected-failure without justification?
- Does any code work around the real problem rather than solving it?
- Were public APIs or contracts bent to accommodate the implementation?

### Implementation integrity
- Does the code follow the patterns and conventions established in the rest of the codebase?
- Does the implementation match what the plan describes, or has it drifted?
- Are there obvious correctness issues — wrong types, missing null checks, off-by-one errors, race conditions?
- Is the code well commented, explaining architecture and "why" rather than just describing what it does?

## Output format

Write a brief, structured report:

1. **Verdict**: `PASS` or `ISSUES FOUND`
2. **Summary**: One paragraph — your overall honest assessment.
3. **Issues** (only if verdict is ISSUES FOUND): Numbered list, each with:
   - What the issue is
   - Where it is (file path and line number or range)
   - Why it matters (not just that it violates a rule, but what could go wrong)
   - Suggested fix

Be concise. Only flag things that actually matter — real omissions, real
hacks, real correctness problems. Do not pad the report with style nits
or cosmetic suggestions.
